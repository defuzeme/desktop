	  *
	  * To send an event you should follow this pattern:
	  * \code
	  * // Create an event associated to the client
	  * RemoteEvent	*event = client->newEvent("authenticationRequest");
	  * // Fill any data field you want
	  * (*event)["msg"] = "All right sir!";
	  * // Send it to the client
	  * event->send();
	  * // You MUST not delete the event by hand, the remote sock will do it when it's done.
	  * \endcode
	  *
	  * To send an event waiting for a reply you should send it like this:
	  * \code
	  * // This will link the given callback to the first received reply
	  * event->sendWithReply(this, SLOT(replyReceived(const RemoteEvent&)));
	  * \endcode
